# Movie Industry: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis in Python, primarily utilizing the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries


## Project Description

This project involves analysis of movie data to determine which factors contribute to successful movies. This is not a comprehensive, in-depth analysis of all aspects of the data, but it is a good foundation to begin understanding what makes movies successful. The first portion involves importing and cleaning the data, and although not all tables will be used, I preliminarily decided to go through and clean all of them. Once the data is cleaned, there are a few questions that I gleaned from the data followed by my recommendations.

## The Data

The data used for this project was pulled from the sources listed below. All tables were cleaned but not all were used in final analysis.

* Box Office Mojo: https://www.boxofficemojo.com
* IMDB: https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/
* Rotten Tomatoes: https://www.rottentomatoes.com
* The Movie Database: https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US

## Objectives

Extract questions and recommendations from the data to determine which factors contribute to making a successful movie.
